Job application;\href{https://github.com/nmontesoro/caapplication}{caapplication};For \href{https://codingallstars.com/}{Coding Allstars}' trial task, I scraped a website and wrote a Python script to translate the HTML text to Hindi. Ensured proper loading of Javascript, CSS, etc. before uploading translated files to a webserver. The result can be found on \href{https://nmontesoro.github.io/caapplication/}{https://nmontesoro.github.io/caapplication/}.
Personal project;\href{https://github.com/nmontesoro/BoletinOficialUNMDP}{BoletinOficialUNMDP} and \href{https://github.com/nmontesoro/SIBOM}{SIBOM};Written in Python, these bots read and summarize the official bulletins for Universidad Nacional de Mar del Plata and the Municipality of General Pueyrred√≥n, tweeting the summaries using Twitter's API. Find them at \href{https://twitter.com/BoletinUnmdp}{@BoletinUnmdp} and \href{https://twitter.com/BoletinMGP}{@BoletinMGP}.
Personal project;\href{https://github.com/nmontesoro/curriculum-vitae}{curriculum-vitae};All the \LaTeX~code necessary to generate this document. The project aims to separate data from formatting for efficient editing and multilingual publishing. Changes to data, like phone number, automatically update the QR code found on the previous page. Code is open-source and available for others to use.
Business application;\href{https://github.com/nmontesoro/Tarjetas_v4}{Tarjetas\_v4};My first Python project at Mejor Carne Argentina automated the weeks-long manual processing of statements from our payment service provider and cross-checking with our own bank statements. It parsed several PDF files, extracted the relevant information, and presented it neatly in an Excel spreadsheet. Although proud of its impact in the company, I would make better choices regarding performance, documentation and naming conventions if I were to write this code today.
University projects;\href{https://github.com/nmontesoro/MetodosNumericos}{MetodosNumericos}, \href{https://github.com/nmontesoro/AyED}{AyED} and \href{https://github.com/nmontesoro/OOP-UNMDP}{OOP-UNMDP};These repositories hold the code I wrote for my classes at Universidad Nacional de Mar del Plata, including Numerical Methods (MATLAB), Algorithms and Data Structures (C), and Object-Oriented Programming (C++/Java).
